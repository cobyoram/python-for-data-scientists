The data scientist uses the survey data to conclude that, on average, users spend 15 minutes surfing the company website before moving on to other things. What is wrong with this conclusion?\n",

It seems reasonable that those who would spend more time on the site are more likely going to answer the survey, causing a bias in the data. Akso the people who are there longer click more links, increasing the likelihood that they'll get the survey."
